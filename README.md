Hello. My name is Hwan Eung Song. I am 25 years old and an IT Major here at NJIT. 
I am new to using terminal so I am taking these classes to learn and understand how to use them.
I am in my junior year so I hope to graduate soon and get into the workforce.
My hobbies are listening to music, playing games with my friends, and just hanging out.
